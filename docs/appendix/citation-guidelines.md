# Citation Management and APA Guidelines

This document provides detailed guidance for maintaining proper citation practices and APA format compliance throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

## Importance of Proper Citations

Academic integrity requires that all sources of information, ideas, and data be properly attributed. In technical documentation and educational content:

- **Credibility**: Proper citations establish the reliability of information
- **Traceability**: Readers can verify claims and access original sources
- **Scholarly Practice**: Following established citation standards
- **Avoiding Plagiarism**: Giving credit where credit is due

## APA Format Requirements (7th Edition)

### In-Text Citations

**Single Author:**
- Parenthetical: (Smith, 2023)
- Narrative: Smith (2023) demonstrated that...

**Two Authors:**
- Parenthetical: (Smith & Jones, 2023)
- Narrative: Smith and Jones (2023) found...

**Three or More Authors:**
- Parenthetical: (Smith et al., 2023)
- Narrative: Smith et al. (2023) reported...

**Multiple Sources in One Citation:**
- (Smith, 2023; Jones, 2022; Brown et al., 2021)

**Direct Quotes:**
- Short quotes (< 40 words): (Author, Year, p. #)
- Long quotes (≥ 40 words): Block format without quotation marks

### Reference List Format

**Journal Articles:**
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical*, volume(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

**Books:**
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work: Capital letter also for subtitle*. Publisher. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

**Web Pages:**
Author, A. A. (Year, Month Date). Title of webpage. *Website Name*. URL

**Technical Documentation:**
Organization Name. (Year). *Title of documentation*. URL

## Technical Documentation Citations

For ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac ROS, and other technical frameworks:

1. **Primary Documentation**: Always cite the official documentation
2. **Version Specificity**: Include version numbers when relevant
3. **URL Access Dates**: Include access dates for web-based documentation
4. **API References**: Cite specific API versions and functions

Example:
Open Robotics. (2023). *ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill Documentation: Publisher-Subscriber Communication*. https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html [Accessed: Dec 2023]

5. **Consistency Review**: Uniform citation style throughout

### Post-Publication Maintenance
- Regular review of cited sources for continued relevance
- Updates when newer sources become available
- Correction of citation errors when discovered
- Addition of sources as the field evolves

## Special Considerations for Technical Content

### Code Examples
- Attribute code from external sources
