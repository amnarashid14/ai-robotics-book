# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

A comprehensive 5000-7000 word technical book covering ROS 2, digital twin simulations, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action models for embodied intelligence and autonomous humanoid systems.

## Overview

This book provides a complete educational resource for students, researchers, and engineers interested in physical AI and humanoid robotics. It covers the four foundational systems needed to build autonomous humanoid robots:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. **Module 2**: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or compatible Linux distribution
- Basic programming knowledge (Python/C++)
- Fundamental understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Minimum 16GB RAM, recommended 64GB
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (minimum RTX 3060, recommended RTX 4090)
